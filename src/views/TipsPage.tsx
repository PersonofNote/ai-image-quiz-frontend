Not sure about what you're seeing? Most of us have an intuitive sense about at least some AI images. There’s an uncanny valley effect - for now.
But sometimes it's not so obvious. When in doubt, there's a few common giveaways to look out for.

const list1 = <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'disc', textAlign: 'left' }}>

<li><strong>Unnatural Hands and Fingers:</strong> too many/too few fingers, distorted or awkwardly positioned digits and limbs - humans and AI both have a lot of trouble with drawing hands</li>
<li><strong>Uncanny Faces:</strong> overly smooth skin with no imperfections, teeth that melt together, "spooky" eyes</li>
<li><strong>Lack of Depth and Texture:</strong> flat or uniform backgrounds or gradients that shouldn't exist with real lighting</li>
<li><strong>Perspective Issues:</strong> strange proportions and perspectives - if it looks like an Escher painting on close examination, it probably isn't a photograph</li>
<li><strong>Overly Uniform Lighting:</strong> Unnatural lighting, "off" shadows or no shadows</li>
</ul>
